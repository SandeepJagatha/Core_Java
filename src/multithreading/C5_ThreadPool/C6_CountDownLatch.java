 * 
 * CountDownLatch works in latch principle, main thread will wait until gate is open. 
 * One thread waits for n number of threads specified while creating CountDownLatch in Java.
 * 
 * Any thread, usually main thread of application, which calls CountDownLatch.await() will wait until 
 * count reaches zero or its interrupted by another thread. All other thread are required to do count down by 
 * calling CountDownLatch.countDown() once they are completed or ready.
 * 
 * 
 * As soon as count reaches zero, Thread awaiting starts running. One of the 
 * disadvantages/advantages of CountDownLatch is that it's not reusable once count reaches to zero you
 *  can not use CountDownLatch any more.
 * 
 * Use CountDownLatch when one thread like main thread, requires to wait for one or more thread to complete, 
 * before it can start processing.
 * 
 * 
 * Classical example of using CountDownLatch in Java is any server side core Java application 
 * which uses services architecture, where multiple services are provided by multiple threads and 
 * application can not start processing until all services have started successfully.

//Create CountDownLatch for N threads
//Create and start N threads
//Main thread wait on latch
//N threads completes there tasks are returns
//Main thread resume execution
